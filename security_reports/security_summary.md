# Security Audit Summary Report

**Generated on:** 2025-10-01 23:44:40
**Project:** QR Code Generator Python

## Audit Tools Used

1. **Safety** - Checks for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **Bandit** - Scans Python code for common security issues  
3. **pip-audit** - Audits Python packages for known vulnerabilities

## Report Files Generated

- `bandit_report.json` - Detailed Bandit security scan (JSON format)
- `bandit_report.txt` - Bandit security scan (Human readable)
- `pip_audit_report.json` - pip-audit vulnerability report (JSON format)
- `security_summary.md` - This summary report

## Recommendations

1. **Review all HIGH and MEDIUM severity issues** from Bandit scan
2. **Update any vulnerable packages** identified by Safety or pip-audit
3. **Run security audits regularly** - ideally before each release
4. **Consider adding security audit to CI/CD pipeline**

## Security Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning
- ✅ Static code analysis for security issues
- ✅ Regular security auditing process
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore to prevent sensitive data leaks
- ✅ Input validation in QR code generation
- ✅ Safe file handling with proper path management

## Next Steps

1. Address any identified vulnerabilities
2. Consider adding pre-commit hooks for security checks
3. Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD
4. Regular dependency updates and security reviews
